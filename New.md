# About Me  
Hello! My name is **Humberto**, but my nick on Discord is **op3n**!  
Since I was 4, I started my journey in technology. At 6, I began learning programming.  
When I was 8, I started to explore everything about technology, servers, Linux, and more.  
At 9, I learned **Python**, **Bash**, and **.cmd / .bat** scripts!  
Now, I love **Linux**, do some **crazy things**, and work on **Artificial Intelligence**, **Python projects**, **Linux distros**, **Discord bots**, and other fun stuff! 🚀

# About Linux and Me  
I love **<span style="color: limegreen;">Open Source</span>** and **Linux**. I started this journey when I was 8.  
For me, it's amazing to work with technology that has no legal restrictions.

  <p>Did you know? My favorite Linux distro is <b>Pop!_OS</b>, but I often experiment with Fedora and Arch Linux too. 🐧</p>

You can put all your stuff on a system, and within a week, you can create an ISO of it. Others can modify and create new things, which makes the community strong and collaborative. One helps the other, and that is **so great**! 💻💡
