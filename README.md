# About Me
Hey! I'm op3n!  
Since I was 4, I started my journey in technology. At 6, I began learning programming.  
When I was 8, I started to explore everything about technology, servers, Linux, and more.  
At 9, I learned **Python**, **Bash**, and **.cmd / .bat** scripts!  
Now, I love **Linux**, do some **crazy things**, and work on **Artificial Intelligence**, **Python projects**, **Linux distros**, **Discord bots**, and other fun stuff! 🚀

# About Linux and Me
I love **Open Source** and **Linux**. I started this journey when I was 8.  
For me, it's amazing to work with technology that has no legal restrictions. You can put all your stuff on a system, and within a week, you can create an ISO of it. Others can modify and create new things, which makes the community strong and collaborative. One helps the other, and that is **so great**! 💻💡

# Now
With this "boom" of **AI**, it's something I really enjoy studying! So, you'll probably see some **AI** projects here as well! 🤖✨

# Can You Help?
Yep, and I welcome you! If you want to talk with me or help out on some projects, you can contact me on **Discord** (Discord nick: **op3n**). 🗨️
