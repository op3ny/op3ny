# About me
Hello! My name is Humberto, but my nick on Discord is op3n!
Since i was 4, i started my journey on technology, with 6 years i started on programming.
When i was 8 i started to learn all about technology, servers, linux and another things.
And with 9 years i learned Python, Bash, and .cmd / .bat scripts!
Now i love Linux, and some Crazy things, and i do Artificial Inteligences, Python Things, Linux distros, discord bots, another crazy things.

# About Linux and Me
I love OpenSource and Linux and i started this journey when i was 8. And for me, is so good a technology witch you can use without "nothing" juridical restrictions. You can put all your stuff on a system, and witch about One Week you can create a ISO of that and another people can modify and create a other things, at resume, one helps the other and that is so great!

# Now
With this "boom" of AI, that's a thing that i liked a lot to study that. So, probably i will have some AI stuff here too!

# Can you help?
